# Lumi Privacy Manager
Proof of concept for 67-475

### Motivation
* Users of apps and services are often presented with long and complex privacy notices, which are highly legalistic. Simply put, they are written by lawyers for lawyers, and is not accessible to the layperson.
* While we recognise the need to have better oversight and control over our privacy, it is an unrealistic burden for users to continually keep abreast of the privacy policies of all the apps that we use. 
* It is also hard to understand the differences between different revisions of the privacy policy, buried in a wall of text. For users who would like to restrict how companies may collect, process and use their data, there are provisions and settings that allow them to opt out or opt in.

### Solution
* Highlight differences between revisions for privacy policies
* Concise and visual brief on the terms and implications, in a way that allows comparison between different companies or service providers
