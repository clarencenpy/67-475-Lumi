			<p>Last Modified: October 28, 2015</p>

			<p>
				Snapchat is a fast and fun way to share experiences with your friends and the world around you. You can send a photo or video Snap to friends, chronicle your day through My Story, touch base using Chat, immerse yourself in global events through Live, and enjoy handcrafted stories from the world&rsquo;s top publishers on Discover.
			</p>

			<p>
				When you use these services—and any others we roll out—you&rsquo;ll inevitably share some information with us. We get that that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.
			</p>

			<p>
				That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve written this privacy policy. And it&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve tried to write it in a way that&rsquo;s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our privacy policy, just ping us.
			</p>

			<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

			<p>
			There are three basic ways we collect information:
			</p>

			<ul class="ui bulleted list">
				<li>Information you choose to give us.</li>
				<li>Information we get automatically when you use our services.</li>
				<li>Information we get from third parties.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Here&rsquo;s a little more detail on each of these categories.
			</p>

			<h3>Information You Choose to Give Us</h3>

			<p>
			When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you: a unique username you&rsquo;d like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information. And, of course, when you contact Snapchat Support or communicate with us in any other way, we&rsquo;ll collect whatever information you volunteer.
			</p>

			<h3>Information We Get Automatically When You Use Our Services</h3>

			<p>
			When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you&rsquo;ve used and how you&rsquo;ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Live Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Snaps to friends. Here&rsquo;s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:
			</p>

			<ul class="ui bulleted list">
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Usage Information</b>. We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:
					<ul class="ui bulleted list">
						<li>how you interact with the services, such as which filters you apply to Snaps or which channels you watch on Discover.</li>
						<li>how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as the time, date, sender, recipient of a message, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Content Information</b>. We collect the content you provide and information about that content, such as if the recipient has viewed the content, replayed the content, and the metadata that is provided with the content.</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Device Information</b>.
					<ul class="ui bulleted list">
						<li>We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).</li>
						<li>We also collect device information that will help us diagnose and troubleshoot problems in the (hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our services.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Device Phonebook</b>. Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we may—with your consent—collect information from your device&rsquo;s phonebook.</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Camera and Photos</b>. Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device&rsquo;s camera and photos. We&rsquo;ll never access the camera or photos unless you give us your consent to do so.</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Location Information</b>. When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Technologies</b>. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique device identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how third parties use these technologies on our services, be sure to read the Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others section of our privacy policy.</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>Log Information</b>. We collect log file information when you use our services. That information includes, among other things:
					<ul class="ui bulleted list">
						<li>details about how you&rsquo;ve used our services</li>
						<li>device information, such as your web browser type and language</li>
						<li>access times</li>
						<li>pages viewed</li>
						<li>IP address</li>
						<li>pages you visited before navigating to our services</li>
						<li>cookies that may uniquely identify your device or browser</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Information We Collect from Third Parties</h2>

			<p>
			We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook—and you&rsquo;re one of that user&rsquo;s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user&rsquo;s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other third-party sources and combine that with the information we collect through our services.
			</p>

			<h2>How We Use Information</h2>

			<p>
			What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:
			</p>

			<div class="padding-left margin-10px">
				<ul class="ui bulleted list">
					<li>develop, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services</li>
					<li>communicate with you</li>
					<li>monitor and analyze trends and usage</li>
					<li>personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information or providing advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles, interests, or previous activities</li>
					<li>enhance the safety and security of our services</li>
					<li>verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity</li>
					<li>use information we&rsquo;ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>
			We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.
			</p>

			<p>
			Although we welcome Snapchatters from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, you consent to us processing and transferring information in and to the United States and other countries whose data-protection and privacy laws may offer fewer protections than those in your home country.
			</p>

			<h2>How We Share Information</h2>

			<p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>

			<ul class="ui bulleted list">
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>With other Snapchatters</b>. We may share the following information about you with other Snapchatters:
					<ul class="ui bulleted list">
						<li>public information, such as your username, Snapcode, name, and profile pictures;</li>
						<li>information about how you have interacted with the services, such as your Snapchat &ldquo;score,&rdquo; the names of Snapchatters you are friends with, and other information that will help Snapchatters understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Snapchat friends in common;</li>
						<li>any additional information you have consented to be shared. For example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook; and</li>
						<li>content you post or send will be shared with other Snapchatters and potentially the public at large; how widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a Snap may be sent to just a single friend you select, but a photo or video submitted to a Live Story may be seen by all Snapchatters and, if the Live Story is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, may be viewed by the public.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>With our affiliates</b>. We may share information with entities within the Snapchat family of companies.
				<li class="margin-10px"><b>With third parties</b>. We may share your information with the following third parties:
					<ul class="ui bulleted list">
						<li>With service providers, sellers, and partners. We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.</li>
						<li>With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
							<ul class="ui bulleted list">
								<li>comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;</li>
								<li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;</li>
								<li>protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or</li>
								<li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Snapchat gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, or acquisition of some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>In the aggregate</b>. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Information You Choose to Share with Third Parties</h2>

			<p>
			The services may also contain third-party links, include third-party integrations (like Pay to Replay), or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that&rsquo;s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.
			</p>

			<h2>Message Deletion and Retention</h2>

			<p>
			Snapchat captures what it&rsquo;s like to live in the moment. So in many cases the messages sent through our services are automatically deleted from our servers once we detect that they have been viewed or have expired. And again in most cases, the services are programmed to delete a message from the recipient&rsquo;s device once it&rsquo;s been viewed or expired as well.
			</p>

			<p>
			There are some exceptions though to this rule. Some of our services, such as My Story, Replay, and Live, allow users to interact with the messages and content you provide through the services for a longer period of time. That means those messages and content may be available on our servers and a recipient&rsquo;s device after they&rsquo;ve been viewed or expired. For example, if you add a Snap to My Story, other users will be able to view it for roughly 24 hours. And because Snaps submitted to Live and other crowd-sourced Stories are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, we may save them indefinitely and allow them to be viewed again through any of our services or third-party sources.
			</p>

			<p>
			But—and this is important—you should understand that users who see your messages or any other content you provide can always save them, either by taking a screenshot or by using some other image-capture technology (whether that be software or even something as old-fashioned as a camera to take a photo of their device&rsquo;s screen). If we&rsquo;re able to detect that a recipient took a screenshot of a message you sent, we&rsquo;ll try to notify you. But the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Don&rsquo;t send messages that you wouldn&rsquo;t want someone to save or share.
			</p>

			<p>
			A few final words on deletion: We can&rsquo;t guarantee that messages and corresponding metadata will be deleted within a specific timeframe. Keep in mind that we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law. This is true even after we&rsquo;ve deleted messages and corresponding metadata from our servers. We also sometimes receive requests from law enforcement requiring us by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific information. Finally, of course, as with any digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients&rsquo; devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.
			</p>

			<h2>Choice and Control over Your Information</h2>

			<p>
			We want you to be in control of your information, so we let you update or correct most of your basic Snapchat account information by editing your account settings within the app. Occasionally we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you update your information. And if you later change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality. And while we hope you&rsquo;ll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here.
			</p>

			<p>
			It&rsquo;s also important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve built a number of tools in settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether you&rsquo;d like to receive Snaps from just your friends or all Snapchatters, and whether you&rsquo;d like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again. 
			</p>

			<h2 id="analytics">Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</h2>

			<p>
			We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies on the services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.
			</p>

			<p>
			Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Snapchat does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral-advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.
			</p>

			<h2>Children</h2>

			<p>
			We don&rsquo;t direct our Services to anyone under 13. And that&rsquo;s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13.
			</p>

			<h2>Revisions to the Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p>
			We may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, we&rsquo;ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we&rsquo;ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy that&rsquo;s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites&rsquo; homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).

			<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

			<p>There are three basic ways we collect information:</p>

            <ul class="ui bulleted list">
              <li><strong>Information you choose to give us.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Information we get when you use our services.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Information we get from third parties.</strong></li>
            </ul>

			<p>Hereís a little more detail on each of these categories.</p>

			<h3>Information You Choose to Give Us</h3>

            <p>When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username youíd like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth.

			<p>Of course, youíll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, such as Snaps and Chats to your friends. Keep in mind that the users you send Snaps, Chats, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Donít send messages or share content that you wouldnít want someone to save or share.</p>

			<p>It probably goes without saying, but weíll say it anyway: When you contact Snapchat Support or communicate with us in any other way, weíll collect whatever information you volunteer.</p>

			<h3>Information We Get When You Use Our Services</h3>

            <p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services youíve used and how youíve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Live Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Snaps to friends. Hereís a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services (to learn about how you can control some of this information, be sure to read the aptly titled Control over Your Information section below):</p>

			<ul class="ui bulleted list">

						<li>how you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or apply to Snaps, which channels you watch on Discover, or which search queries you submit.</li>
						<li>how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Content Information</strong>. We collect information about the content you provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content, replayed the content, and the metadata that is provided with the content.</li>

We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).</li>

				<li><strong>Device Phonebook</strong>. Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we mayówith your consentócollect information from your deviceís phonebook.</li>
				<li><strong>Camera and Photos</strong>. Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your deviceís camera and photos. Weíll access your camera and photos only after you give us your consent.</li>
				<li><strong>Location Information</strong>.When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>
				<li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies</strong>. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features.

						<li>pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Information We Collect from Third Parties</h3>

			<p>We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebookóand youíre one of that userís contactsówe may combine the information we collect from that userís phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other companies that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and combine that with the information we collect through our services.</p>

			<h2>How We Use Information</h2>

			<p>What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:</p>

			<ul class="ui list">
				<li>develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services</li>
				<li>communicate with you</li>
				<li>monitor and analyze trends and usage</li>
				<li>personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads</li>

				<li>use information weíve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them</li>
				<li>enforce our Terms of Service and other usage polices</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.</p>

			<h2>How We Share Information</h2>

			<p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>

			<ul class="ui bulleted list">
				<li><strong>With other Snapchatters</strong>. We may share the following information with other Snapchatters:
					<ul>
						<li>information about you, such as your username and name;</li>
						<li>information about how you have interacted with the services, such as your Snapchat ìscore,î the names of Snapchatters you are friends with, and other information that will help Snapchatters understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Snapchat friends in common;</li>
						<li>any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook; and</li>
						<li>content you post or send will be shared with other Snapchatters; how widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a Snap may be sent to just a single friend you select, but your My Story content may be seen by any Snapchatter whom you allow to see your My Story.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>With all Snapchatters and the general public</strong>. We may share the following information with all Snapchatters as well as the general public:
                  <ul>
                    <li>public information like your Snapcode and profile pictures; and</li>
                    <li>any content that you submit to Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced service. If a Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it may be viewed by the public at large.</li>
                  </ul>
				<li><strong>With our affiliates</strong>. We may share information with entities within the Snapchat family of companies.</li>
				<li><strong>With third parties</strong>. We may share your information with the following third parties:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>With service providers, sellers, and partners.</strong> We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.</li>
						<li><strong>With third parties for legal reasons.</strong> We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
							<ul>
								<li>comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;</li>
								<li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;</li>
								<li>protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or</li>
								<li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition.</strong> If Snapchat gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>In the aggregate or after de-identification</strong>. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Information You Choose to Share with Third Parties</h2>

			<p>The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service thatís being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.</p>

			<h2>How Long We Keep Your Content</h2>

			<p>Snapchat lets you capture what itís like to live in the moment. On our end, that means that we automatically delete the content of your Snaps (the photo and video messages that you send your friends) from our servers after we detect that a Snap has been opened or has expired. But remember: There are various ways Snapchatters can save your content and also upload it to Snapchat (like as an attachment in Chat). We go into more detail below about how users can save Snapchat content.</p>

			<p>Outside of Snaps, the rest of our services may use content for longer periods of time, which means those services may follow different deletion protocols. So, for example, we retain your Story content a bit longer than Snaps so that your friends have more time to view your Story.  Or, if you submit content to one of our inherently public features, such as Live, Local, or any other crowd-sourced service, we may retain the content indefinitely. If you have any questions about how a feature works you can just pop on over to our Support Site.</p>

			<p>Finallyóand this is importantóyou should understand that users who see the content you provide can always save it using any number of techniques: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. Itís also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a deviceís temporary storage. Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. And we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.</p>

			<h2 id="control-over-your-information">Control over Your Information</h2>

			<p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.</p>

            <ul class="ui bulleted list">
              <li class="item"><strong>Access and Updates</strong>. We strive to let you access and update most of the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests weíll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic account information right in the app by visiting the appís Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request here. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We will try to update and access your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course disclose the fee before we comply with your request.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Revoking Permissions</strong>. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</li>
              <li><strong>Account Deletion</strong>. While we hope youíll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here. If you ask to delete your account, you will have up to 30 days to restore your account before we delete your information from our servers. During this period of time, your account will not be visible to other Snapchatters.</li>
              <li><strong>Communicating with other Snapchatters</strong>. Itís also important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with. Thatís why weíve built a number of tools in Settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether youíd like to receive Snaps from just your friends or all Snapchatters, and whether youíd like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again. For more information about how to control your privacy settings, check out our Support Site.</li>
            </ul>

			<h2 id="analytics">Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</h2>

			<p>We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on the services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.</p>

			<p>Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Snapchat does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral-advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>

			<h2>Users Outside the United States</h2>

			<p>Although we welcome Snapchatters from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, we operate our services from the United States. This means that we may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries whose local data-protection and privacy laws may offer fewer protections than those in your country of residence or from any country where you use or access the services.</p>

			<h2>Children</h2>

			<p>Our services are not intended foróand we donít direct them toóanyone under 13. And thatís why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13.</p>

			<h2>Revisions to the Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, weíll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, weíll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy thatís available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websitesí homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).</p>

On the Twitter Services, your name and username are listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some Twitter Services, such as searching and viewing public user profiles, do not require registration.</p><p><br /><strong>Contact Information</strong>: You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or enable Services, for example, for login verification, Twitter via SMS, or Digits by Twitter. If you provide Twitter with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from Twitter. When you use Digits by Twitter to sign up for or login to a third-party application, you are directing Twitter to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that application. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from the Twitter Services. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website. Your privacy settings control whether others can find you on the Twitter Services by your email address or phone number.</p><p><br /><strong>Additional Information</strong>: You may provide us with profile information to make public on the Twitter Services, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find users you know or help other users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time. Learn more here. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your account on the other service. Learn more here. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p><p><br /><strong>Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information</strong>: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Twitter Services is information you are asking us to make public. Your public information includes the messages you Tweet; the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted and the client application you used to Tweet; the language, country, and time zone associated with your account; and the lists you create, people you follow, Tweets you mark as likes or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Twitter Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Twitter Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features, like direct messages, to make the information more private if you want. The Twitter Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Twitter content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p><p><br /><strong>Location Information</strong>: Twitter may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on Twitter.com. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Learn more about our use of location here, and how to set your location preferences here.</p><p><br /><strong>Links</strong>: Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p><p><br /><strong>Cookies</strong>: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.</p><p><br /><strong>Log Data</strong>: When you use our Services, we may receive information (&#8220;<strong>Log Data</strong>&#8221;) such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another application through Twitter. Twitter uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services, to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.</p><p><br /><strong>Widget Data</strong>: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (&#8220;<strong>Widget Data</strong>&#8221;). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting, de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in. Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. Learn more about the feature, including how you can suspend it or turn it off, here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.</p><p><br /><strong>Commerce Services</strong>: You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, &#8220;<strong>Payment Information</strong>&#8221;), along with your shipping address, to complete a commerce transaction through our Services. You may also provide your credit or debit card number to register for card-linked services, such as offers. To facilitate future purchases, we store your Payment Information, excluding CVV code, and shipping address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information and shipping address private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your purchases made through our Services (&#8220;<strong>Transaction Data</strong>&#8221;). If you register your credit or debit card with Twitter for card-linked services, we receive information about the card transactions from a third-party payment services provider or card network (&#8220;<strong>Registered Card Data</strong>&#8221;). Transaction Data and Registered Card Data may include the merchant&#8217;s name and the date, time and amount of the transaction. Twitter uses Registered Card Data to verify eligibility for card-linked services, and may also use Registered Card Data to limit the number of offers available to you and keep track of your offers.</p><p><br /><strong>Third-Parties and Affiliates</strong>: Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in off of our Services. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account will not be matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads. Learn more about your privacy options here and about how ads work on our Services here. We may also receive information about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates&#8217; services, including the delivery of ads.</p><h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3><blockquote class="g-quote"><p><strong>Tip</strong>: We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p></blockquote><p><strong>User Consent or Direction</strong>: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account. Other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo on the Twitter Services. If you&#8217;ve shared information, like direct messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses the Twitter Services through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p><p><br /><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards. We may share your credit or debit card number with payment services providers or card networks to monitor card transactions at participating merchants and track redemption activity for the purposes of providing card-linked services.</p><p><br /><strong>Sellers of Goods and Services</strong>: If you buy goods or services through our Services, we may provide the seller, commerce provider or marketplace with your name, email address, shipping address, Payment Information and Transaction Data to facilitate payment processing, order fulfilment and dispute resolution (including payment and shipping disputes) and to help prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to these third parties&#8217; privacy policies for information about their privacy practices.</p><p><br /><strong>Law and Harm</strong>: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Twitter&#8217;s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party&#8217;s, including a government&#8217;s, request to disclose your information.</p><p><br /><strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates</strong>: In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates&#8217; services, including the delivery of ads.</p><p><br /><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information</strong>: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your name or contact information).</p><h3>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</h3><p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can download certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here and request access to additional information here.</p><p><br />You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and Twitter to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.</p><p><br />Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter Services or deactivated your account. Learn more here.</p><h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3><p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us here. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child&#8217;s account. You can find additional resources for parents and teens here.</p><h3>EU Safe Harbor Framework</h3><p>Twitter complies with the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce website.</p><h3>Changes to this Policy</h3><p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at https://twitter.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @Twitter update or email to the email address associated with your account.

If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.</p><p><br /><strong>Widget Data</strong>: We may tailor the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (&#8220;<strong>Widget Data</strong>&#8221;). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting, de-identifying, or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. We may use Widget Data to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow and other content you may be interested in. Tailored content is stored with only browser cookies or device IDs and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. Learn more about the feature, including how you can suspend it or turn it off, here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.</p><p><br /><strong>Commerce Services</strong>: You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, &#8220;<strong>Payment Information</strong>&#8221;), along with your shipping address, to complete a commerce transaction through our Services. To facilitate future purchases, we store your Payment Information (excluding CVV code) and shipping address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information and shipping address private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your purchases made through our Services (&#8220;<strong>Transaction Data</strong>&#8221;). Transaction Data may include the merchant&#8217;s name and the date, time, and amount of the transaction.</p><p><br /><strong>Third-Parties and Affiliates</strong>: Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your device as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in off of our Services. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account will not be matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads. Learn more about your privacy options for tailored ads here and about how ads work on our Services here. We may also receive information about you from our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates&#8217; services, including the delivery of ads.</p><h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3><blockquote class="g-quote"><p><strong>Tip</strong>: We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p></blockquote><p><strong>User Consent or Direction</strong>: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account. Other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they mention you, share a photo of you, or tag you in a photo. Your privacy settings control who can tag you in a photo on the Twitter Services. If you&#8217;ve shared information, like direct messages or protected Tweets, with another user who accesses the Twitter Services through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p><p><br /><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards. </p><p><br /><strong>Commerce Transactions</strong>: If you make a payment as part of a commerce transaction through our Services, we may provide the seller, commerce provider, marketplace, or charity with your name, email address, shipping address, Payment Information and Transaction Data to facilitate payment processing, order fulfilment, and dispute resolution (including payment and shipping disputes) and to help prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to these third parties&#8217; privacy policies for information about their privacy practices.</p><p><br /><strong>Law and Harm</strong>: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Twitter&#8217;s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party&#8217;s, including a government&#8217;s, request to disclose your information.</p><p><br /><strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates</strong>: In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates&#8217; services, including the delivery of ads.</p><p><br /><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information</strong>: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your name or contact information).</p><h3>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information</h3><p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can download certain account information, including your Tweets, by following the instructions here and request access to additional information here.</p><p><br />You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and Twitter to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.</p><p><br />Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from the Twitter Services or deactivated your account.
